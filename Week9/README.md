## Algos in arrays

Doc. Semergiev talked about some problems from the 1-st semester exam like:  
  * How to delete from array
  * Advanced indexing for moving in the array (like that one i used in the exam)
  * Advanced moving in 2D arrays for completing task 2B in HW2  

N.B. : Write a boolean func that compares wherever 2 colors are close(CheckWiki for algos)
